As you may have seen, sys-boot/plymouth has had a last-minute reprieve:

  https://github.com/gentoo/gentoo/commit/fc982a5

As such, _if_ you have temporarily unmasked it (as directed in my previous news
items, of 2017-08-06 and 2017-08-07), you should now undo those changes, as
they are no longer necessary. To do so, issue:

  rm -v /etc/portage/package.unmask/plymouth
  rm -v /etc/portage/profile/package.use.mask/plymouth

and of course sync your Gentoo tree, using your preferred method.

Best,

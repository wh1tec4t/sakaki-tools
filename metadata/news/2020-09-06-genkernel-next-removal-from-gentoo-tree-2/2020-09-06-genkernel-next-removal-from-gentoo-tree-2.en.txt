Per dilfridge@gentoo.org (2020-07-11), re sys-kernel/genkernel-next:

"Fails to build with recent glibc, bug 719968
 Removal in 30 days"

And on 2020-08-20, the package was actually removed [1].

To work around this in the short term (as it is a dependency of buildkernel)
I have added v70 of genkernel-next to the sakaki-tools overlay, including
iadegesso's busybox version patch. To use it, if you are applying a
global mask for the sakaki-tools  overlay, you will need to do the
following:

  emaint sync --repo sakaki-tools
  echo "~sys-kernel/genkernel-next-70" >> /etc/portage/package.unmask/genkernel-next

Also, as this version uses sys-apps/busybox-1.32.0, which is currently
keyworded ~amd64, if working on the stable branch you will need to issue:

  echo "~sys-apps/busybox-1.32.0 ~amd64" >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/busybox

Once done, update these tools:

  emerge -av1u sys-kernel/genkernel-next sys-apps/busybox

after which you should be able to use buildekernel successfully again.

NB: the instructions in this news item supercede those of the similar
item posted on 2020-08-21.

Further work will need to be done to adapt the buildkernel script to work
with the baseline genkernel; this is just a short-term workaround. PRs
welcome!

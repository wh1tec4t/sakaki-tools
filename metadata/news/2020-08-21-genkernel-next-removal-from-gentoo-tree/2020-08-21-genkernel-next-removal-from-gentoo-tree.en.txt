Per dilfridge@gentoo.org (2020-07-11), re sys-kernel/genkernel-next:

"Fails to build with recent glibc, bug 719968
 Removal in 30 days"

And on 2020-08-20, the package was actually removed [1].

To work around this in the short term (as it is a dependency of buildkernel)
I have added v69 of genkenrnel-next to the sakaki-tools overlay. To use it,
if you are applying a global mask for this overlay, you will need to do the
following:

  emaint sync --repo sakaki-tools
  echo "~sys-kernel/genkernel-next-69" >> /etc/portage/package.unmask/genkernel-next

Further work will need to be done to adapt the buildkernel script to work
with the baseline genkernel; this is just a short-term workaround. PRs
welcome!

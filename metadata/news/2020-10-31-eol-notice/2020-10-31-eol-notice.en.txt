sakaki stepping down from EFI Install Guide / sakaki-tools maintenance
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear fellow Gentoo enthusiasts -

I am afraid I have some difficult news to share.

Sadly, due to legal obligations arising from a recent change in my
'real world' job, I must announce I am standing down as maintainer
of Sakaki's EFI Install Guide [1] and the underlying sakaki-tools
repo [2] with immediate effect.

For more details to the background of this decision, please see [3].

For the meantime, I will leave the EFI Install Guide and sakaki-tools
repo up (for historical interest and since they may be of use to
others); however, I plan no further updates, nor will I be accepting
or actioning further pull requests / bug reports from this point.
Email requests for support will also have to be politely declined ><.
I will continue to monitor the various Gentoo forums, but will be
unable to provide in-depth technical responses to queries, and any
responses may be somewhat delayed.

If you have used my EFI guide to install your Gentoo system, it
*should* still continue to work for some time, *but* you should now
take steps to migrate to a baseline Gentoo Handbook install (since
the underlying tools, such as buildkernel [4], will also now no longer
be supported and may eventually fail as more modern kernels etc.
are released).

My sincere and heartfelt apologies to those who have contributed to,
used and installed systems based on this guide over the more than
six years since I first released it (seems such a long time ago now!).

And my heartfelt thanks to the fantastic team of devs and enthusiasts
who make up the Gentoo and community (a particular shout out to
NeddySeagoon!). It's been an honour to be a part of those endeavours
for a little while, and I hope the guide, overlay and tools have
helped, in some small way, to make the process of bringing up a
Gentoo system more straightforward for beginners.

So, kind regards, stay well, and I trust our paths may cross again
in the future ^-^

Sayounara!

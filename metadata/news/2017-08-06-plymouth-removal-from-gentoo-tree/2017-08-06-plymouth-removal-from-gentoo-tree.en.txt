Per mgorny@gentoo.org (04 Aug 2017):

"sys-boot/plymouth is unmaintained since Apr 2016. The current version
 has multiple bugs, including not supporting OpenRC. It really needs
 an active maintainer. Removal in 30 days. Bug #621470."

and accordingly, sys/boot plymouth (and the plymouth USE flag) have been
masked, pending deletion.

To work around this in the short term (for use with buildkernel etc.)
please unmask plymouth and the plymouth USE flag, thus:

  echo "sys-boot/plymouth" > /etc/portage/package.unmask/plymouth
  mkdir -pv /etc/portage/profile/package.use.mask
  echo "gnome-base/gdm -plymouth" > /etc/portage/profile/package.use.mask/plymouth
  echo "sys-kernel/genkernel-next -plymouth" >> /etc/portage/profile/package.use.mask/plymouth

Over the next month (before plymouth is removed) I will look at whether it
makes sense to take over the genkernel, gdm and plymouth ebuilds into the
sakaki-tools overlay, and maintain them patched for plymouth use going forward,
or whether it makes more sense simply to drop the graphical boot splash
capability. There is also the possibility a maintainer will be found. If you
feel strongly that plymouth should be retained, please add your comment
to bug 621470 before the one-month deadline:

Apologies for the inconvenience caused by this (and thanks to spijet for
bringing it to my attention).

Introduction
------------

I have become aware of a bug in the app-portage/porthash-1.0.6
repository verification script, which will cause the automatic weekly
update (genup) process to fail for users of the gentoo-on-b2 and
gentoo-on-b3 images. *A manual upgrade of this package is required* to
address this issue, the (simple) process for which is presented in this
news article, immediately below.

Apologies for any inconvenience caused ><

Fixing the Issue
----------------

To address the issue, open a terminal and issue the following commands,
as the root user, on your b2 or b3:

# emaint sync --repo sakaki-tools
# emerge --update --oneshot --verbose app-portage/porthash

This should upgrade porthash to >= 1.0.7. Once this is done, your
automatic weekly genup run should start working again.

That's it!

Background to the Issue (Optional Reading)
------------------------------------------

The porthash utility creates, or by default checks, the validity of a
repository master hash (repo.hash) and counterpart digital signature
(repo.hash.asc), to allow verification of a Portage tree distributed
over an unauthenticated channel such as rsync. There was no such
'official' facility in Gentoo when the tool was originally deployed.

However, when Gentoo started rolling out its official app-portage/gemato
manifest verification tool, porthash was modified (at v1.0.6) to migrate
the location of the repo.hash{,.asc} files, from the top level
/usr/portage/ directory (where they would clash with gemato) to
/usr/portage/local/, which gemato ignores.

Unfortunately, during an rsync process of the Portage tree with the
isshoni.org binhost, this local directory is *not* synced by default,
but since (due to faulty logic; my bad) porthash-1.0.6 checks this
location first when looking for the repo.hash{,.asc} files, the next
time the tree is synced after the files have been migrated, the old
(stale) /usr/portage/local/repo.hash{,.asc} files will be checked (not
the fresh /usr/portage/repo.hash{,.asc} versions), and accordingly the
signature verification will fail, and genup will halt with an error.

This error is addressed in >=porthash-1.0.7, so upgrading this single
package is sufficient to fix the problem.

Thanks to orion777 and ericbish for reporting.

This is an erratum for my news item of 2017-08-06, regarding plymouth unmasking.

The initial 2 revisions of that news item (since fixed) instructed you to do
the following to unmask plymouth:

  echo "sys-boot/plymouth" > /etc/portage/package.unmask/plymouth
  mkdir -pv /etc/portage/package.use.mask
  echo "gnome-base/gdm -plymouth" > /etc/portage/package.use.mask/plymouth
  echo "sys-kernel/genkernel-next -plymouth" >> /etc/portage/package.use.mask/plymouth

That was incorrect, as per the portage(5) documentation package.use.mask is not
usable in /etc/portage; it needs to go into /etc/portage/profile
instead. As such, the instructions should have read:

  echo "sys-boot/plymouth" > /etc/portage/package.unmask/plymouth
  mkdir -pv /etc/portage/profile/package.use.mask
  echo "gnome-base/gdm -plymouth" > /etc/portage/profile/package.use.mask/plymouth
  echo "sys-kernel/genkernel-next -plymouth" >> /etc/portage/profile/package.use.mask/plymouth

If you have already followed the previous news item's instructions, and so
have an /etc/portage/package.use.mask directory, simply do the following to
put it into the correct location:

  mkdir -pv /etc/portage/profile
  mv /etc/portage/package.use.mask /etc/portage/profile/

After this, you should be able to emerge buildkernel etc.

Apologies >< for the inconvenience caused by this (and thanks to cmosh for
bringing it to my attention).

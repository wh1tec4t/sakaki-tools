As of OpenRC 0.28 [1], the efivarfs is mounted (on /sys/firmware/efi/efivars)
read-only by default (it was previously mounted read-write, and indeed
systemd still mounts it read-write).

This behaviour prevents tools like efibootmgr (and their clients, such
as buildkernel) from writing changes to e.g., the EFI boot list, causing an
error if such operations are attempted (which they will be from time to time,
during the normal usage workflow of these tools).

To work around this until the various affected software has been patched (to
temporarily remount rw before sensitive operations need to be performed,
remounting ro again afterwards), you can append something like the following
to your /etc/fstab:

efivarfs /sys/firmware/efi/efivars efivarfs rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime 0 0

On next reboot, OpenRC will respect your explicit settings, allowing tools
needing efivarfs write access to be used again.

Users of buildkernel on systemd need take no action at this time.

Best,

The saga that is sys-boot/plymouth continues ^-^

As of the time of writing, the two in-tree (non-live) versions of plymouth
(0.9.2-r1 and 0.9.3) do not build correctly on some systems.

This appears to be due to the fact that sys/sysmacros.h has been purged
from glibc in Gentoo (but not in some other distros)[1].

A bug has been filed (#627690)[2] with a patch, but this has not yet been
committed. However, you can easily apply this patch now if you like. Simply
issue (as root):

  mkdir -pv /etc/portage/patches/sys-boot/plymouth-0.9.{2-r1,3-r0}
  cat > /etc/portage/patches/sys-boot/plymouth-0.9.2-r1/plymouth-sysmacros.patch <<EOF
--- a/src/libply-splash-core/ply-terminal.c
+++ b/src/libply-splash-core/ply-terminal.c
@@ -32,6 +32,7 @@
 #include <sys/socket.h>
 #include <sys/stat.h>
 #include <sys/types.h>
+#include <sys/sysmacros.h>
 #include <termios.h>
 #include <unistd.h>
 #include <wchar.h>

EOF
  cp /etc/portage/patches/sys-boot/plymouth-0.9.{2-r1,3-r0}/plymouth-sysmacros.patch

And you should then be able to emerge plymouth successfully.

The patches have deliberately been placed in revision-specific directories, so
that if the in-tree ebuilds are bumped they will no longer apply.

Best,
